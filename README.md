# Chop Chop! 

## Overview
“We already have food at home!” Everyone’s heard it but how many people can actually whip up a meal from the array of ingredients at home? Introducing Chop Chop! Our app will allow you to choose ingredients in your pantry or fridge and give you recipes to make. 

With Chop Chop you can find new recipes with even the most unrelated ingredients. Our app will also allow you to choose recipes from our database and display the ingredients.
